## 2026-08-08 02:24 EDT - Repository bootstrap

- Stage/phase: Pre-Phase-0 (repository creation)
- Component/port: none - no code written
- What changed: Created public repo `rmholston420/oh-gui`. Imported the OH-GUI
  Master Build Spec v4.0/v4.1 split-file set (20 files) to `docs/specs/`.
  Isolated the superseded v3.0 monolith to `docs/specs/archive/` with a README
  enumerating the rejected ideas it still contains, per
  `docs/specs/99-appendix-superseded.md`.
- Files touched: `docs/specs/*.md` (20 spec files),
  `docs/specs/archive/OH-GUI-Master-Build-Spec-v3.md`,
  `docs/specs/archive/README.md`, `BUILD_LOG.md`, `DEBUG_LOG.md`,
  `PORTING_LEDGER.md`
- Ports/adapters affected: none
- ADR / ledger updated: `PORTING_LEDGER.md` created (empty, headers only).
  No ADR filed yet - the repo-role decision below is a candidate ADR-0001.
- Decision recorded (pending formal ADR): `rmholston420/oh-gui` is an **overlay
  repo**, not a fork. `OpenHands/OpenHands` at tag `v1.12.0` is cloned separately
  and extended in place per `docs/specs/00-ground-truth.md`; this repo holds
  specs, ADRs, operational logs, and OH-GUI-owned source, tracking the delta
  against upstream. This preserves the EXTEND-not-fork constraint and keeps
  upstream rebasable.
- Stop-condition status: Repo created and specs pushed. **Stopped here.**
  Phase 0 not started. No baseline metrics, no architecture decision record, no
  first-run wizard, no household-mode timing decision. Phase 0 exit criterion
  (`docs/specs/02-repo-setup.md`) is not met and was not attempted.

## 2026-08-08 02:42 EDT - ADR-001 ratified: integration boundary reversed to standalone app

- Stage/phase: Pre-Phase-0 (architecture decision)
- Component/port: integration boundary; no code written
- What changed: User clarified the actual requirement - never modify OpenHands source,
  keep upgrading it freely, build a custom GUI plus middleware that changes regularly.
  This is incompatible with the spec's "EXTEND, not fork / extend in place" premise.
  Investigated the live upstream surface and found a supported consumption boundary the
  spec never mentioned: the Agent Server (Docker, HTTP + WebSocket, SESSION_API_KEY),
  `@openhands/typescript-client` (browser-compatible, remote conversations only), and the
  `openhands-sdk` pip family. Ratified ADR-001: OH-GUI is a standalone app, OpenHands is a
  pinned runtime dependency, middleware is Python and owns the entire policy plane, and
  Agent Canvas is reclassified from base to donor.
- Files touched: `adrs/ADR-001-integration-boundary.md` (new), `adrs/README.md` (new),
  `docs/specs/README.md`, `docs/specs/00-ground-truth.md`, `docs/specs/02-repo-setup.md`,
  `docs/specs/12-portable-components.md`, `docs/specs/13-hard-constraints.md`,
  `docs/specs/99-appendix-superseded.md`, `PORTING_LEDGER.md`
- Ports/adapters affected: Agent Canvas added as primary donor. Runtime dependencies
  recorded as pinned artifacts, explicitly not ports. A middleware anti-corruption layer
  is now a required component (ADR-001 item 7).
- ADR / ledger updated: ADR-001 filed and ratified; ADR index created; PORTING_LEDGER
  gained a donor section, a runtime-dependency section, and the full Python policy-plane
  primitive list.
- Spec version: v4.0/v4.1 -> **v4.2**. Six new gates in 13-hard-constraints.md; the
  "extend in place, never duplicate" gate retired. Options A/B/C and the TypeScript-
  middleware alternative recorded as rejected in 99-appendix-superseded.md.
- Decisions recorded: (1) standalone app over Agent Server API; (2) middleware in Python,
  chosen because confirmation policies, analyzers, StuckDetector and block_action are
  Python SDK objects and the Agent Server API surface could not be verified complete;
  (3) Agent Canvas vendored as MIT donor with attribution rather than extended.
- Risks logged: `@openhands/typescript-client` is alpha with no stability guarantee;
  agent-server tags are commit SHAs not semver; no formal OpenAPI document, versioning
  policy, or deprecation guarantee was found for the Agent Server API.
- Stop-condition status: Spec is now internally consistent under v4.2 and ADR-001 is
  ratified. **Stopped here.** No scaffolding created, no code written, Phase 0 not
  started. Phase 0 exit criterion remains unmet: baseline metrics report, first-run
  wizard, and the household-mode timing decision are all outstanding.
